    "* A L2 and L3 tunnel : An Ethernet in UDP inside an IP tunnel. \n",
    "* Standards: RFC 7348, 7432 \n",
    "* Agnostic to the data-plane encapsulation \n",
    "* Supported by VMWare NSX, Cisco ACI & NXOS7k, Cumulux, Arista etc \n",

    "* __Replacing VLANS :__ 12bits (4K) to 24bits (16M) possible segments.\n",
    "* __Allows L2 multiplathing:__ Does not need STP for Loop-Prevension rather uses L3 ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path) over CLOS fabric (Similar logic to FabricPath), suitable for Spine-Leaf architecture. Capable of establishing L2 connectivity between Private and Public cloud.\n",
    "* __Includes Scalling enhacement:__ Optimises CP (e.g. MAC learning, ARP tables, Brodcast-unknown-multicast (BUM) replication, etc.). \n",
    "* __Evolution:__ In __classic ethernet__ Access-Distribution communication was Active-Standby based. The next iteration was __Virtual Port-Channel (vPC)__ that supports dual-homing with etherchannel but does not supprot scale-out. Then __Fabric-Path__ was introduced which gives L2 communication with port binding to multiple DSW but does not have an active control-plane. A BGP based CP was introduced over Fabric path called __Dynamic Fabric Automation (DFA)__ but never took off. __VxLAN-BGP__ is replacing DFA. \n",
    "* __Does not break L2 adjacency:__ Allows any stateless L2 and L3 transport (e.g. vMotion)\n",
    "* __Allows multi-tenency:__ Customer segrication over shared underlay fabric. Allows overlapping L2 and L3 addresses similar to MPLS L3 VPN. \n",
    "* VLAN numbers and IP addresses are locally significant. \n",
