    "# What is QoS ? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics \n",
    "\n",
    "* QoS stands for Quality of Service \n",
    "* What problem does it solve?\n",
    "    * Provides __predictable management of network resources__ during times of congestion.\n",
    "    * assist in __maximising the end-user experience__ of critical sessions. A email traffic may be delayed but not a voice/video traffic.  \n",
    "    * provides __differentiated services__ to packets based upon pre-defined user criteria. User may define which traffic is more critical than other. \n",
    "* How does QoS provide those services?\n",
    "    * There are many QoS features. Some features only performs single job, others do multiple jobs.\n",
    "    * The core tasks that a QoS feature may accomplish can be as follows. Some features performs one one, some does multiple.\n",
    "        * __Classification of Data__: Segrigation os streams from an unified traffic. \n",
    "        * __Queue Management__: Size, placement of packets (which packet goes to which queue), Scheduling order, Transmission Rate (Traffic Shapping). \n",
    "        * __Preemptive drops__: rate limit multiple ingress interfaces to prevent an egress interface to get overloaded.   \n",
    "        * __Marking of packets__: Mark packets based on its class to tell the router to treat them with different priority.  \n",
    "* __Quality of Experience (QoE)__: The result an user experience as an end-to-end consequece of QoS policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Packet life cycle \n",
    "\n",
    "__Packer life cycle in a Router__\n",
    "\n",
    "* packet arrived on the ingress interface (RX-RING). Interface has a DMA access to certain part of the memory called RX-RING.\n",
    "* Packet queued in the memory buffer. Memory sends HW-interrupt to the CPU and relinquish control of the memory location in RX-RING to the CPU. Based on different switching algorithm (Process, Fast, CEF) router processes it.\n",
    "* RIB/FIB lookup is done and forwording decission is made. \n",
    "* Packet header is manipulated and it is placed on the Tx-RING. \n",
    "* CPU relinqished the control of the TX-RING memory location to the Egress interface and the interface puts it on the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The avobe process is mainly used in a roter. However in a switch, the process is different. Memory architecture of a switch could be of two types\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Shared Memory__: In smaller switches e.g. Catalist 3500/4500, the interfaces and the ASIC (Forwarding engine) share a central TCAM memory block via a memory manager (MMU). A schedular makes a predictable schedule of the process. CPU does not see any of the process, everything is handled by the ASIC. CPU performs tasks like Spanning-Tree etc. \n",
    "* __Distributed Memory__: In a larger switches e.g. Catalist 6500 series, there are multiple line card (Supervisor engine or Control plane  and Interface Cards or Data Plane). Each DP line card has multiple interfaces with deficated ASIC that mainly performs simple jobs like FCS chek. Each interface-ASIC has their own memory (devided in Tx and Rx memory). All these individual ASIC has an access to the upstream Supervisor. ASICs in the Supervisor Engine decides the destination address and signals the appropriate eggress ASIC to send it. The mode of communication between Supervisor and Line ASICs could be via a Bus or a Ring. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Packet Life Cycle in a Shared Memory system__\n",
    "    * packer arives on the ingress interface\n",
    "    * interface ASIC immidiately forwards the packet into common shared memory pool.\n",
    "    * forward decission is made by the forwarding ASIC \n",
    "    * memory ownership is transfered to the interface ASIC \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Packet Life Cycle in a Distributed Memory system__\n",
    "    * Packet arrives on an ingress interface. \n",
    "    * Interface/port ASIC places it into a local Queue/Buffer.\n",
    "    * Forwards the packet to the Forworking engine via a BUS or a RING.\n",
    "    * Forwrding ASIC makes a forwarding decission. \n",
    "    * packet transmitted onto shared ring/bus to the egress buffer. \n",
    "    * egrees interface ASIC puts it into the line. \n",
    "    \n",
    "As a core takeaway, it is clear that during the process the data must be stored temporarily somewhere in the device, typically in a buffer. The router manages this buffer with software, a switch does the same in hardware level. If there is no congestion, QoS is not needed. Commonly the Egress buffer suffers from congestion as the ingress interfaces are typically rate-limited by the ISP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Buffers and Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Buffer__\n",
    "    * physical memory used to store packets before and after the forwarding decisions are made.\n",
    "    * On routers this same memory can be allocated to interface as ingress/egress queues.\n",
    "    * Shared memeory (of which, part is allocated as buffers) is also used by lots of other CPU processes.\n",
    "* __Queues__\n",
    "    * On routers a queue is a logical part of the shared memory buffers.\n",
    "    * On switches, individual interfaces (or line-cards) have their own memroy which is used as interface queues. \n",
    "* Buffer-Queue Configuration\n",
    "    * Configuration os buffer is not normally part of QoS\n",
    "    * Buffer configuration would involve modifying the quantity of buffes allowed for particuar sized packet\n",
    "    * __Buffer-Tuning__ in cisco IOS is not generally recomanded.\n",
    "    * QoS configuration is only applicable to queeues. \n",
    "    * QoS does not alter the physical buffer size, rather it controls how packets are treated inside a queue. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### What is Congestion?\n",
    "    \n",
    "* During times of no congestion, QoS is not needed. Packets forwarding follows a FIFO mode in Rx-Tx ring. \n",
    "* __Egresss Congestion__: Packet forwarded to egress interface faster than Tx-RING can handle them. \n",
    "* __Ingress Congestion__: Packets arrive in multiple ingress interface faster than the forwarding engine can process them (not a typical scenario). In modern routers and switches the lookup processes are doen in hardware level, therefore it looksup millions of packets per seconds, i.e. 10~20 times faster than the line rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Result of a Congestion\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Delay__:  Typically the intr-frame space is fixed. Delay is the __Uniformly scaled IFS__. Delay is irritating for a voice.  \n",
    "* __Jitter__: Jitter is the __Ununiformly scalled IFS__. Jitter kills voice traffic. \n",
    "* __Drops__: Packets gets dropped (in a voice minor drops are not persivable but not for video). \n",
    "\n",
    "### QoS Protocols \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Intigrated Services__\n",
    "    * QoS model in which entire E2E pcket for a packet is __ensured certain minimum QoS charactesistics prior to the packet transmision__.\n",
    "    * Initial RFC by IETF in 1990s : RFC 1633, 2211, 2212\n",
    "    * __RSVP__ used a primary protocol to setup the path.\n",
    "        * Requires every node along the path to heed its reservation. \n",
    "        * Requires every node along the path to keep per-flow state. \n",
    "    * __Limitation of IS:__\n",
    "        * In a heterogenious environment over an E2E communication is realistic as different devices perhaps use different protocols (especially for ISP communication)\n",
    "* __Differentiated Services__\n",
    "    * Designed to address the challenses of IS \n",
    "    * RFC : 2474,2597, 2598,3245 and 4594\n",
    "    * The DS model describes various behavious to be adopted by each complient node (Called Per-Hop Behaviour or __PHB__)\n",
    "    * No prior reservation but QoS is called when a packet hits am intermediate router.     "

You may also configure an ACL to mark different packets differently.    \n",
